## Featur es

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
   - Provisioned cloud infrastructure using [Terraform/CloudFormation/Ansible].
   - Included components:
     - VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, and Firewall Rules.
     - Compute environment with Docker.
   - Best practices for scalability, security, and maintainability.

2. **Backend Deployment:**
   - Containerized backend API (Node.js/Python REST API).
   - Deployed to cloud with HTTPS (SSL/TLS) enabled for secure communication.

3. **Secure Configuration:**
   - Sensitive data managed using [AWS Secrets Manager/Vault/environment variables].
   - No hard-coded credentials or sensitive information in the repository.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Automated deployments via [GitHub Actions/Jenkins/GitLab CI/CD].
   - Pipeline includes:
     - Docker image build.
     - Deployment to cloud.
     - Version control for IaC and pipeline code.

docker pull sreecharan94848/streamlit-app


### Textual Description:
- **Infrastructure:**  
  A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is created with public and private subnets. Security Groups are configured to allow HTTPS traffic to the API. Compute resources are provisioned to host the Docker container. 

- **Deployment:**  
  The backend API is containerized using Docker and deployed on the cloud infrastructure. The application is accessible only via HTTPS, secured with SSL/TLS certificates.

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  A pipeline automates Docker image builds and deploys the application to the cloud. Secrets are securely managed and injected during the deployment process.
